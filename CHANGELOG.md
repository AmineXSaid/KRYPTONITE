# Changelog

## 0.4.0

Bundled skills, Act button in brand green, and a Control Center fix.

### Fixed
- **Control Center crashed on open since 0.3.0.** Two bugs:
  (1) The stroke shorthand `SW` used by every icon in `controlCenter.js` was
  never declared — it was called `S6` in the sidebar, and the CC copy was never
  updated when the crystal refactor renamed it. Every icon `<path>` threw a
  `ReferenceError` at parse time, which killed the IIFE before `mount()`.
  (2) In a VS Code webview, `<script src>` tags can race: `controlCenter.js`
  read `window.__kxCrystal` synchronously at init, but `crystal.js` sometimes
  hadn't finished loading yet. Both surface scripts now poll for readiness
  before running, so load order cannot break them.
- Defensive guards added to `renderStrip` and section renderers for missing
  `tls.ca`, `proxy.noProxy`, and `files` arrays on profile DTOs.

### Added
- **All 17 Anthropic skills ship inside the extension.** The `skills/` directory
  at the extension root contains every skill from
  `github.com/anthropics/skills`: algorithmic-art, brand-guidelines,
  canvas-design, claude-api, doc-coauthoring, docx, frontend-design,
  internal-comms, mcp-builder, pdf, pptx, skill-creator, slack-gif-creator,
  theme-factory, web-artifacts-builder, webapp-testing, xlsx. The loader already
  scanned `<extensionPath>/skills/` as a bundled directory; this populates it.
  Workspace skills in `.agent/skills/` still override bundled ones by name.
- `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` from the Anthropic skills repository.

### Changed
- **Act button is Kryptonite green.** The Plan / Act segment now reads as
  purple / emerald — `--kx-active` for Plan, `--kx-accent` for Act — matching
  the brand identity. Previously Act used `--vscode-button-secondaryBackground`
  which was a nondescript grey.

## 0.3.1

Composer fixes, file attachments, and UI polish from user testing.

### Fixed
- **Textarea showed a scrollbar when empty.** The overflow was always `auto`;
  now it starts as `hidden` and only switches to `auto` once the content exceeds
  `max-height`. A `min-height: 32px` prevents the input area from collapsing.
- **Textarea shrank below its usable height.** The autoGrow calculation reset
  height to `auto` without a floor, and the scrollbar fought the layout. Both
  are now coordinated: height clamps at 32px–120px and overflow follows.

### Added
- **File attachments.** The paperclip button opens a native file picker (images,
  documents, all files, up to 10 MB). Chosen files appear as removable pills
  above the textarea. Images are sent as base64 content blocks when the profile
  has vision enabled; the client layer already handles both OpenAI and Anthropic
  image wire formats. Attachments clear on send and on session switch.
- **Image rendering in transcripts.** User messages with image content blocks
  render inline thumbnails in the chat bubble, both live and on session restore.

### Changed
- **Aura animation reworked.** Adopted the user's heartbeat timing: a single
  ring snaps outward on each beat rather than orbiting continuously. The swirl
  layer and second staggered ring are removed. The animation is tighter and
  calmer.

## 0.3.0

New brand mark, and a rebuilt session mechanism.

### Fixed
- **New chat did nothing visible.** `newChat` cleared the transcript on the host
  and rotated the session id, but broadcast no message that told the webview to
  clear. The conversation stayed on screen while the host had already moved on.
- **Every message became its own session.** A consequence of the above: because
  the screen never changed after pressing New chat, each subsequent message was
  filed under a freshly rotated id. The history popover filled with one-message
  sessions. Session identity now changes in exactly one place, and every change
  is announced with `sessionSwitched`.
- **Tool calls were never persisted.** The agent loop accumulated assistant and
  tool messages in a local array and dropped it on return; the controller then
  rebuilt history as a lossy `user` / `assistant` pair. The model re-read files
  it had already read, and a restored session could not render its tool cards.
  The loop now reports each message it appends through `onMessage`.
- **A window reload split conversations.** Each extension-host start minted a
  new session id. The active id is persisted in `workspaceState` and the
  transcript is picked back up on activation.
- **The user's message was recorded after the turn, not before.** A webview
  reloading mid-stream re-rendered a transcript that did not contain the
  question it was answering. The user turn is now written before the model is
  called, so a host that dies loses the reply but never the question.

### Added
- History popover shows message counts, marks the active conversation, and has
  a per-row delete. New inbound message `deleteSession`.
- `media/logo.png` — a 128×128 tile, registered as the extension `icon`. The
  manifest previously had none.
- `media/webview/crystal.js` — the brand mark as a single shared asset loaded by
  both surfaces. It used to be a verbatim copy in each webview script.

### Changed
- **New crystal artwork.** A faceted cluster traced from the source logo:
  eighteen facets over four emerald gradients above a dark union silhouette,
  plus three highlight slivers. Portrait 42:48 rather than the old landscape
  48:30, so `crystal(height)` derives the width and no call site can stretch it.
  The silhouette is load-bearing — without it the gaps between facets show the
  host background and the cluster reads as shattered on a light theme.
- **The waiting indicator is a dark-green aura.** Two staggered expanding
  pulses, a masked conic sweep orbiting the mark, a breathing core and a beating
  crystal, all in deep emerald so the aura sits behind the mark rather than
  out-shouting it. `prefers-reduced-motion` still falls back to a static
  crystal.
- The activity-bar icon is a reduced six-shard cluster, thickened so the gaps
  survive VS Code masking it to flat monochrome at 16–24px. The full silhouette
  rendered as a blob.
- Outbound `sessionRestored` is now `sessionSwitched`, and it is emitted for new
  chats and deletions as well as loads.
- `SessionMetaDto` gains `count` and `active`; `StateSync.session` gains
  `title`.

## 0.2.0

First release under the KRYPTONITE name.

### Added
- Sidebar webview: session transcript, tool cards, per-file diff cards, todo
  card, in-chat permission cards, plan phase, slash and `@` quick picks,
  model picker grouped by profile, context meter.
- Control Center editor tab with ten sections covering endpoints, wire formats,
  auth, TLS/mTLS, proxy, diagnostics, agent, skills, checkpoints and logs.
- Plan phase: read-only tool set plus a fenced `plan` block parsed into a card.
- `update_todos` tool backing the todo card.
- Per-file diff accept/reject against the shadow-git snapshot.
- Turn replay so a webview reloaded mid-stream catches up.
- `authCacheReport()` — cache keys and expiries, never tokens.
- `ShadowRepo.numstat`, `restoreFile`, `fileDiff`.
- `EndpointClient.close()`; clients pooled per profile.

### Fixed
- OAuth2 exchange cache used tokens for 30s **after** expiry. The skew is now
  the standard early refresh: stop using the token 30s **before** it expires.

### Changed
- Config namespace is `kryptonite.*` with five keys.
- Approval modes are `ask | edits-auto | full-auto`.
- Approvals render in the transcript rather than as modal dialogs.
